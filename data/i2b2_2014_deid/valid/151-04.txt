			Assessment and plan:

   It looks like Mr. Quin has had an MI sometime in the past. Myocardial scans showed only mild ischemia in the territory of the prior MI.  Since he is asymptomatic, I would continue medical therapy.  For some reason, he has not started Lipitor.  His LDL is markedly elevated.  My target LDL would be below 70.  For his myocardial protection, I have suggested that he increase the dose of Toprol from 25 mg. qd to 50 mg. qd.
