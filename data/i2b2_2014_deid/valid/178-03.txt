Dear Ms. Gustafson, 


I have just received your test results and I would like to share them with you.



Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 7.30 on 01/29/2123. It has remained stable compared to the last value of 7.10 on 10/29/2122. Hemoglobin A1c is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months. We would like to keep it below 7.


I suggest a trial of metformin 500mg twice daily
test your sugars to keep below 140 2 hours after meals

If you have any questions about these results, please do not hesitate to contact me.
